Data Merging Basics

===================================================================================================

Inner join

Your first inner join

You have been tasked with figuring out what the most popular types of fuel used in Chicago taxis are. 
To complete the analysis, you need to merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables together on the vid column. 
You can then use the merged table along with the .value_counts() method to find the most common fuel_type.

Since you'll be working with pandas throughout the course, the package will be preloaded for you as pd in each exercise in this course. 
Also the taxi_owners and taxi_veh DataFrames are loaded for you.
Merge taxi_owners with taxi_veh on the column vid, and save the result to taxi_own_veh.

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid')

# Print the column names of the taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

Index(['rid', 'vid', 'owner_x', 'address', 'zip', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'fuel_type', 'owner_y'], dtype='object')
-------------------------------------------------
Set the left and right table suffixes for overlapping columns of the merge to _own and _veh, respectively.

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes=('_own','_veh'))

# Print the column names of taxi_own_veh
print(taxi_own_veh.columns)

Index(['rid', 'vid', 'owner_own', 'address', 'zip', 'make', 'model', 'year', 'fuel_type', 'owner_veh'], dtype='object')
-------------------------------------------------
Select the fuel_type column from taxi_own_veh and print the value_counts() to find the most popular fuel_types used.

# Merge the taxi_owners and taxi_veh tables setting a suffix
taxi_own_veh = taxi_owners.merge(taxi_veh, on='vid', suffixes=('_own','_veh'))

# Print the value_counts to find the most popular fuel_type
print(taxi_own_veh['fuel_type'].value_counts())

Inner joins and number of rows returned

All of the merges you have studied to this point are called inner joins. 
It is necessary to understand that inner joins only return the rows with matching values in both tables. 
You will explore this further by reviewing the merge between the wards and census tables, 
then comparing it to merges of copies of these tables that are slightly altered, named wards_altered, 
and census_altered. The first row of the wards column has been changed in the altered tables. 
You will examine how this affects the merge between them. The tables have been loaded for you.

For this exercise, it is important to know that the wards and census tables start with 50 rows.
Merge wards and census on the ward column and save the result to wards_census.
-------------------------------------------------
# Merge the wards and census tables on the ward column
wards_census = wards.merge(census, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_census
print('wards_census table shape:', wards_census.shape)

wards_census table shape: (50, 9)
-------------------------------------------------
Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column, and notice the difference in returned rows.

# Print the first few rows of the wards_altered table to view the change 
print(wards_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards_altered and census tables on the ward column
wards_altered_census = wards_altered.merge(census, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_altered_census
print('wards_altered_census table shape:', wards_altered_census.shape)

wards_altered_census table shape: (49, 9)
-------------------------------------------------
Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column, and notice the difference in returned rows.

# Print the first few rows of the census_altered table to view the change 
print(census_altered[['ward']].head())

# Merge the wards and census_altered tables on the ward column
wards_census_altered = wards.merge(census_altered, on='ward')

# Print the shape of wards_census_altered
print('wards_census_altered table shape:', wards_census_altered.shape)

-------------------------------------------------

One-to-many relationships

One-to-many merge

A business may have one or multiple owners. 
In this exercise, you will continue to gain experience with one-to-many merges by merging a table of business owners, 
called biz_owners, to the licenses table. Recall from the video lesson, with a one-to-many relationship, 
a row in the left table may be repeated if it is related to multiple rows in the right table. In this lesson, 
you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)

The licenses and biz_owners DataFrames are loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Starting with the licenses table on the left, merge it to the biz_owners table on the column account, and save the results to a variable named licenses_owners.
Group licenses_owners by title and count the number of accounts for each title. Save the result as counted_df
Sort counted_df by the number of accounts in descending order, and save this as a variable named sorted_df.
Use the .head() method to print the first few rows of the sorted_df.

# Merge the licenses and biz_owners table on account
licenses_owners = licenses.merge(biz_owners, on='account')

# Group the results by title then count the number of accounts
counted_df = licenses_owners.groupby('title').agg({'account':'count'})

# Sort the counted_df in desending order
sorted_df = counted_df.sort_values(by='account', ascending=False)

# Use .head() method to print the first few rows of sorted_df
print(sorted_df.head())

                 account
title                   
PRESIDENT           6259
SECRETARY           5205
SOLE PROPRIETOR     1658
OTHER               1200
VICE PRESIDENT       970
-------------------------------------------------

Merging multiple DataFrames

Total riders in a month
Your goal is to find the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station (station_name == 'Wilson') when riding 
Chicago's public transportation system on weekdays (day_type == 'Weekday') in July (month == 7). Luckily, Chicago provides this detailed data, 
but it is in three different tables. You will work on merging these tables together to answer the question. 
This data is different from the business related data you have seen so far, but all the information you need to answer the question is provided.

The cal, ridership, and stations DataFrames have been loaded for you. The relationship between the tables can be seen in the diagram below.

Table diagram. The cal table relates to ridership via year, month, and day. The ridership table relates to the stations table via station_id.
cal = [year, month, day, date_type]
ridership = [station_id, year, month, day, rides]
stations = [station_id, station_name, location]
-------------------------------------------------
Merge the ridership and cal tables together, starting with the ridership table on the left and save the result to the variable ridership_cal. 
If you code takes too long to run, your merge conditions might be incorrect.

# Merge the ridership and cal tables
ridership_cal = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day'])
-------------------------------------------------
Extend the previous merge to three tables by also merging the stations table.

# Merge the ridership, cal, and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day']) \
            				.merge(stations, on='station_id')
-------------------------------------------------
Create a variable called filter_criteria to select the appropriate rows from the merged table so that you can sum the rides column.

# Merge the ridership, cal, and stations tables
ridership_cal_stations = ridership.merge(cal, on=['year','month','day']) \
							.merge(stations, on='station_id')

# Create a filter to filter ridership_cal_stations
filter_criteria = ((ridership_cal_stations['month'] == 7) 
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['day_type'] == 'Weekday') 
                   & (ridership_cal_stations['station_name'] == 'Wilson'))

# Use .loc and the filter to select for rides
print(ridership_cal_stations.loc[filter_criteria, 'rides'].sum())

-------------------------------------------------
Three table merge
To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. 
A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are. 
A table with the median income by zip code has been provided to you. You will merge the licenses and wards tables with this new income-by-zip-code table called zip_demo.

The licenses, wards, and zip_demo DataFrames have been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Starting with the licenses table, merge to it the zip_demo table on the zip column. Then merge the resulting table to the wards table on the ward column. 
Save result of the three merged tables to a variable named licenses_zip_ward.
Group the results of the three merged tables by the column alderman and find the median income.

# Merge licenses and zip_demo, on zip; and merge the wards on ward
licenses_zip_ward = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on='zip') \
            			.merge(wards, on='ward')

# Print the results by alderman and show median income
print(licenses_zip_ward.groupby('alderman').agg({'income':'median'}))

                             income
alderman                           
Ameya Pawar                 66246.0
Anthony A. Beale            38206.0
...
William D. Burns           107811.0
Willie B. Cochran           28024.0
-------------------------------------------------
One-to-many merge with multiple tables

In this exercise, assume that you are looking to start a business in the city of Chicago. 
Your perfect idea is to start a company that uses goats to mow the lawn for other businesses. 
However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. 
You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. 
You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. 
The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. 
The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.

The land_use, census, and licenses tables have been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Merge land_use and census on the ward column. 
Merge the result of this with licenses on the ward column, 
using the suffix _cen for the left table and _lic for the right table. Save this to the variable land_cen_lic.

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward') \
                .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))
-------------------------------------------------
Group land_cen_lic by ward, pop_2010 (the population in 2010), and vacant, then count the number of accounts. Save the results to pop_vac_lic.

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward') \
                    .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby(['ward','pop_2010','vacant'], 
                                   as_index=False).agg({'account':'count'})
-------------------------------------------------
Sort pop_vac_lic by vacant, account, andpop_2010 in descending, ascending, and ascending order respectively. Save it as sorted_pop_vac_lic.

# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use.merge(census, on='ward') \
                    .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic.groupby(['ward','pop_2010','vacant'], 
                                   as_index=False).agg({'account':'count'})

# Sort pop_vac_lic and print the results
sorted_pop_vac_lic = pop_vac_lic.sort_values(by=['vacant','account','pop_2010'], 
                                             ascending=[False,True,False])

# Print the top few rows of sorted_pop_vac_lic
print(sorted_pop_vac_lic.head())

   ward  pop_2010  vacant  account

Merging Tables With Different Join Types

===================================================================================================

Enriching a dataset

Setting how='left' with the .merge()method is a useful technique for enriching or enhancing a dataset with additional information from a different table. 
In this exercise, you will start off with a sample of movie data from the movie series Toy Story. 
Your goal is to enrich this data by adding the marketing tag line for each movie. You will compare the results of a left join versus an inner join.

The toy_story DataFrame contains the Toy Story movies. The toy_story and taglines DataFrames have been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Merge toy_story and taglines on the id column with a left join, and save the result as toystory_tag.

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

      id        title  popularity release_date                   tagline
0  10193  Toy Story 3      59.995   2010-06-16  No toy gets left behind.
1    863  Toy Story 2      73.575   1999-10-30        The toys are back!
2    862    Toy Story      73.640   1995-10-30                       NaN
(3, 5)
-------------------------------------------------
With toy_story as the left table, merge to it taglines on the id column with an inner join, and save as toystory_tag.

# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='inner')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)

      id        title  popularity release_date                   tagline

Right join to find unique movies

Most of the recent big-budget science fiction movies can also be classified as action movies. 
You are given a table of science fiction movies called scifi_movies and another table of action movies called action_movies. 
Your goal is to find which movies are considered only science fiction movies. Once you have this table, you can merge the movies table in to see the movie names. 
Since this exercise is related to science fiction movies, use a right join as your superhero power to solve this problem.

The movies, scifi_movies, and action_movies tables have been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Merge action_movies and scifi_movies tables with a right join on movie_id. Save the result as action_scifi.

# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right')
-------------------------------------------------
Update the merge to add suffixes, where '_act' and '_sci' are suffixes for the left and right tables, respectively.

# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# Print the first few rows of action_scifi to see the structure
print(action_scifi.head())

   movie_id genre_act        genre_sci
0        11    Action  Science Fiction
1        18    Action  Science Fiction
2        19       NaN  Science Fiction
3        38       NaN  Science Fiction
4        62       NaN  Science Fiction
-------------------------------------------------
From action_scifi, subset only the rows where the genre_act column is null.

# Merge action_movies to the scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi['genre_act'].isnull()]
-------------------------------------------------
Merge movies and scifi_only using the id column in the left table and the movie_id column in the right table with an inner join.

# Merge action_movies to the scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi['genre_act'].isnull()]

# Merge the movies and scifi_only tables with an inner join
movies_and_scifi_only = movies.merge(scifi_only, how='inner', left_on='id', right_on='movie_id')

# Print the first few rows and shape of movies_and_scifi_only
print(movies_and_scifi_only.head())
print(movies_and_scifi_only.shape)

(258, 7)
-------------------------------------------------
Popular genres with right join

What are the genres of the most popular movies? To answer this question, you need to merge data from the movies and movie_to_genres tables. 
In a table called pop_movies, the top 10 most popular movies in the movies table have been selected. 
To ensure that you are analyzing all of the popular movies, merge it with the movie_to_genres table using a right join. 
To complete your analysis, count the number of different genres. Also, the two tables can be merged by the movie ID. 
However, in pop_movies that column is called id, and in movies_to_genres it's called movie_id.

The pop_movies and movie_to_genres tables have been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Merge movie_to_genres and pop_movies using a right join. Save the results as genres_movies.
Group genres_movies by genre and count the number of id values.

# Use right join to merge the movie_to_genres and pop_movies tables
genres_movies = movie_to_genres.merge(pop_movies, how='right', 
                                      left_on='movie_id', 
                                      right_on='id')

# Count the number of genres
genre_count = genres_movies.groupby('genre').agg({'id':'count'})

# Plot a bar chart of the genre_count
genre_count.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()
-------------------------------------------------
Using outer join to select actors
One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all rows from both merged tables and null where they do not match, 
you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other table. To try for yourself, 
you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular movies: Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. 
Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to find actors who did not act in both movies.

The Iron Man 1 table is called iron_1_actors, and Iron Man 2 table is called iron_2_actors. 
Both tables have been loaded for you and a few rows printed so you can see the structure.
-------------------------------------------------
Save to iron_1_and_2 the merge of iron_1_actors (left) with iron_2_actors tables with an outer join on the id column, and set suffixes to ('_1','_2').
Create an index that returns True if name_1 or name_2 are null, and False otherwise.

iron_1_actors #########

3  Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow  1245  Scarlett Johansson

# Merge iron_1_actors to iron_2_actors on id with outer join using suffixes
iron_1_and_2 = iron_1_actors.merge(iron_2_actors,
                                     on='id',
                                     how='outer',
                                     suffixes=('_1','_2'))

# Create an index that returns true if name_1 or name_2 are null
m = ((iron_1_and_2['name_1'].isnull()) | 
     (iron_1_and_2['name_2'].isnull()))

# Print the first few rows of iron_1_and_2
print(iron_1_and_2[m].head())

-------------------------------------------------
Self join

Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. 
In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. 
You have been given a table called crews, which has columns id, job, and name. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. 
This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. 
Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. 
This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.

The crews table has been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
To a variable called crews_self_merged, merge the crews table to itself on the id column using an inner join, 
setting the suffixes to '_dir' and '_crew' for the left and right tables respectively.

# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner', suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))
-------------------------------------------------
Create a Boolean index, named boolean_filter, 
that selects rows from the left table with the job of 'Director' and avoids rows with the job of 'Director' in the right table.

# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner',
                                suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a Boolean index to select the appropriate
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == 'Director') & 
     (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != 'Director'))
direct_crews = crews_self_merged[boolean_filter]
-------------------------------------------------
Use the .head() method to print the first few rows of direct_crews.

# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner',
                                suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a boolean index to select the appropriate rows
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == 'Director') & 
                  (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != 'Director'))
direct_crews = crews_self_merged[boolean_filter]

# Print the first few rows of direct_crews
print(direct_crews.head())

Index merge for movie ratings
To practice merging on indexes, you will merge movies and a table called ratings that holds info about movie ratings. 
Make sure your merge returns all of the rows from the movies table and not all the rows of ratings table need to be included in the result.

The movies and ratings tables have been loaded for you.
-------------------------------------------------
Merge movies and ratings on the index and save to a variable called movies_ratings, ensuring that all of the rows from the movies table are returned.

# Merge to the movies table the ratings table on the index
movies_ratings = movies.merge(ratings,left_index=True, right_index=True)

# Print the first few rows of movies_ratings
print(movies_ratings.head())

Do sequels earn more?
It is time to put together many of the aspects that you have learned in this chapter. In this exercise, 
you'll find out which movie sequels earned the most compared to the original movie. 
To answer this question, you will merge a modified version of the sequels and financials tables where their index is the movie ID. 
You will need to choose a merge type that will return all of the rows from the sequels table 
and not all the rows of financials table need to be included in the result. 
From there, you will join the resulting table to itself so that you can compare the revenue values of the original movie to the sequel. 
Next, you will calculate the difference between the two revenues and sort the resulting dataset.

The sequels and financials tables have been provided.
-------------------------------------------------
With the sequels table on the left, merge to it the financials table on index named id, 
ensuring that all the rows from the sequels are returned and some rows from the other table may not be returned, Save the results to sequels_fin.

# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')
-------------------------------------------------
Merge the sequels_fin table to itself with an inner join, 
where the left and right tables merge on sequel and id respectively with suffixes equal to ('_org','_seq'), saving to orig_seq.

# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True,
                             suffixes=('_org','_seq'))

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']
-------------------------------------------------
Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff columns of orig_seq and save this as titles_diff.

# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True,
                             suffixes=('_org','_seq'))

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']

# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff 
titles_diff = orig_seq[['title_org', 'title_seq', 'diff']]
-------------------------------------------------
Sort by titles_diff by diff in descending order and print the first few rows.

# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True,
                             suffixes=('_org','_seq'))

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']

# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff 
titles_diff = orig_seq[['title_org','title_seq','diff']]

# Print the first rows of the sorted titles_diff
print(titles_diff.sort_values('diff', ascending=False).head())

               title_org        title_seq       diff
